                    Some 13.5 million people were conscripted into forced labor in the German Reich during the Second World War. 
                    Maintaining the war economy was only possible thanks to the conscripted workers, prisoners of war, and 
                    concentration camp inmates. They were used in all economic sectors and became part of everyday life in 
                    National Socialist Germany as the war progressed.<sup><a href=\"#endnote1\" id=\"footnote1\">1</a></sup>
                    Among other things, concentration camp prisoners were used in the armaments industry, which the National 
                    Socialists began to relocate underground in 1943 in the face of Allied air superiority. The production of 
                    modern interceptors and rockets in bomb-proof tunnels was intended to avert the increasingly clear signs of 
                    defeat in the war. The majority of the gigantomaniac projects were never completed and most of the production 
                    facilities were never put into operation. The living and working conditions for the concentration camp prisoners 
                    were especially harsh and claimed thousands of lives. The death of Jewish prisoners in particular was calculated 
                    as part of “extermination through work.” The prisoners’ individual chances of survival depended not least on 
                    their assigned work detail. Prisoners who had the necessary professional qualifications or had been trained for 
                    their work detachments over a longer period of time were considered less replaceable.<sup><a href=\"#endnote2\" id=\"footnote2\">2</a></sup>

                    An underground production facility for 10,000 workers was also to be set up in a former ore mine in Thil, France, 
                    by a Volkswagen subsidiary. To this end, VW engineer Arthur Schmiele traveled to the Auschwitz-Birkenau 
                    concentration and extermination camp in June 1944 to select workers from among the Jewish prisoners previously 
                    deported from Hungary. Schmiele put together a group of 500 and a group of 300 men, whom he selected after 
                    checking their professional qualifications as skilled metal workers and a short aptitude test. Accordingly, 
                    both groups contained many metalworkers and some engineers, as well as people from other professions who pretended 
                    to have the appropriate qualifications. Despite their short time in Auschwitz-Birkenau, they had probably realized 
                    that being assigned to a work detachment outside Auschwitz offered a better chance of 
                    survival.<sup><a href=\"#endnote3\" id=\"footnote3\">3</a></sup>

                    The prisoners mainly came from areas in the northeast of what is present-day Romania. In 1940, Romania had 
                    been forced by Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy to cede these areas to Hungary. After the German occupation of 
                    Hungary in March 1944, the German occupiers and Hungarian authorities quickly set up ghettos for the Jewish 
                    population, including on May 3 in what was then Nagyvárad and in Kolozsvár, now Oradea and Cluj Napoca – places 
                    from which many of the deportees in this group came. The Jewish population of the two ghettos was deported to the 
                    Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration and extermination camp at the end of May and beginning of June 1944. There, the 
                    families were separated by gender and all the elderly, sick, or children as well as the mothers and pregnant 
                    women among the deportees were murdered in the gas chambers. Only those prisoners classified as fit for work 
                    survived the selection.<sup><a href=\"#endnote4\" id=\"footnote4\">4</a></sup> As survivors later reported, the 
                    group selected from these transports was very diverse; some had spoken Hungarian in their parents’ homes, 
                    others Romanian, German, Serbian, Yiddish, or a combination of these languages. Some among the group were very 
                    religious, for others religion played no role, some even had Christian families, but all of them were persecuted 
                    as Jews by the National Socialists. Some were already over 50 and others under 20 years of age, with the youngest 
                    only 14 years old. Several fathers managed to be assigned to the group together with their sons, and other prisoners 
                    were already acquainted through their common region of origin or related to each other.<sup><a href=\"#endnote5\" id=\"footnote5\">5</a></sup>

                        Judaism or self-identification was decisive for their persecution by the National Socialists. At the heart of the 
                        National Socialist worldview was a racist antisemitism that defined Jews according to their descent. Christians and 
                        atheists were also persecuted as Jews by the National Socialists, regardless of their self-definition or cultural 
                        affiliation, if they met their criteria of descent. Not all of the persons referred to here as Jews identified themselves 
                        as Jewish, but they were all persecuted as Jewish.

            <div class=\"col-lg-8\">
                <p>
                    In 1938 / 1939, Volkswagen GmbH, which had been founded a year earlier, set up its plant near Fallersleben 
                    in what is today Wolfsburg. After the start of the war, cars were not produced there for the German civilian 
                    population as originally planned, but instead armaments orders were taken on. The Volkswagen Group also made 
                    use of the various forms of National Socialist forced labor. By the end of 1944, forced laborers made up two 
                    thirds of the workforce; in total, some 200,000 persons were compelled to perform forced labor at Volkswagen, 
                    many of whom did not survive the working conditions. In addition to civilian forced laborers, Soviet prisoners 
                    of war and Italian military internees, this also included a total of about 5,000 concentration camp inmates. 
                    After the history of the VW Group under National Socialism had become the subject of extensive public discussion 
                    and academic research in the 1980s and 1990s, the VW plant today accommodates a memorial to forced labor on 
                    the site.<sup><a href=\"#endnote7\" id=\"footnote7\">7</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Compared to other concentration camp prisoners, the 300er Group at the VW plant was relatively well looked after. 
                    Even though they did not receive new clothes, they were protected from the weather by their accommodation. 
                    Although set too low for the work required of them, food rations were more extensive than in other camps. 
                    The symptoms of malnutrition typical of many concentration camps, which often led to the death of the prisoners in 
                    the long term, did not initially occur in the 300er Group.<sup><a href=\"#endnote8\" id=\"footnote8\">8</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Due to the prisoners’ training and intended function, the SS and VW initially had an interest in their survival, 
                    but this only extended to the duration of the war and the associated necessity of underground V1 production. 
                    After the war, survivors testified in interviews or memoirs that after their experiences in Auschwitz-Birkenau 
                    and the subsequent concentration camps, in retrospect their time at the Volkswagen factory seemed bearable by 
                    comparison.<sup><a href=\"#endnote9\" id=\"footnote9\">9</a></sup>

                        Forced labor was used in all branches of industry, but also in agriculture and in private households. 
                        Forced laborers were a visible part of everyday life in National Socialist Germany, especially in the

                    At the end of June 1944, the Group’s production facility was destroyed in an Allied bombing raid. Surviving 
                    the attack in a bunker, after a few days the Group was deported from the completely destroyed factory to another 
                    production facility in occupied France. On their way to the camp, which was located in occupied Lorraine, 
                    the Group learned of the Allied landing in Normandy. According to survivor David Hollander, the confirmation 
                    of this news was “the happiest moment” during his imprisonment in a concentration 
                    camp.<sup><a href=\"#endnote10\" id=\"footnote10\">10</a></sup> In Thil, they also met up again with the 
                    Group of 500 men who had been selected together with them in Auschwitz-Birkenau. Here, too, the 300 men were 
                    isolated. Survivors reported that they had to set up their own barracks camp, including a crematorium, which 
                    was separated from the other prisoners by a fence.<sup><a href=\"#endnote11\" id=\"footnote11\">11</a></sup>
                    During the selections, the men had often been separated from friends and relatives, some of whom they now saw 
                    again through the fence. However, any contact was strictly prosecuted. Survivor Eliesar Farkas, among others, 
                    reported that a prisoner in the other group had recognized his brother and sought a conversation with him at 
                    the fence, whereupon he was shot.<sup><a href=\"#endnote12\" id=\"footnote12\">12</a></sup> Survivor Alex Rosenbaum, 
                    on the other hand, managed to secretly exchange a few words with his father in the other camp.<sup><a href=\"#endnote13\" id=\"footnote13\">13</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                    As the production facility in Thil had not yet been completed, the Group was mainly used for clearing and 
                    construction work, despite their extensive training. The Group was also regularly sent to a nearby French village. 
                    Despite being guarded, prisoners there managed to make contact with the French civilian population and the French 
                    resistance movement, the Résistance. Survivors such as Pal Arie testified that one prisoner was even able to 
                    escape with the help of the French Résistance and was taken through the front lines to the US Army, where he was 
                    able to report on the V1 production.<sup><a href=\"#endnote14\" id=\"footnote14\">14</a></sup>
                    The US Army was able to liberate Paris at the end of August. Long before production could begin in Thil, the 
                    satellite camp was evacuated at the beginning of September 1944 as the Allies approached.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Group was then initially transferred to the Rebstock satellite camp of Buchenwald concentration camp. 
                    Here, too, an underground production facility was to be built, but it never went into production. The Group 
                    had previously been increased to 300 again to replace the murdered prisoner and the escaped prisoner. The Group 
                    was deported again at the end of September, this time to the Mittelbau-Dora concentration camp. Due to air raids, 
                    the transport was on the move for several days and probably also stopped at civilian railroad stations for some time.

                    The Mittelbau-Dora concentration camp was originally set up in August 1943 as a satellite camp of Buchenwald 
                    concentration camp as part of the relocation of the armaments industry underground. In October 1944, it was 
                    declared an independent concentration camp. A list compiled after the war assumes that 13,796 prisoners were 
                    already imprisoned in the Mittelbau-Dora main camp by the beginning of November 1944. In total, at least 
                    60,000 prisoners were detained in Mittelbau-Dora – the main camp and satellite camps – during its existence, 
                    with at least 20,000 murdered as a result of the working conditions and the violence inflicted by the guards. 
                    Today a memorial is located at the site of the former concentration camp.<sup><a href=\"#endnote15\" id=\"footnote15\">15</a></sup>

                    Many prisoners from the 300er Group did not survive their time in Mittelbau-Dora. Unlike before, the Group was 
                    no longer isolated there, but above all they were no longer better cared for. Survivors reported on the 
                    unstoppable loss of weight, which meant a race against time in view of the soon hoped-for liberation. In an 
                    account of his time in prison published after the war, survivor Dezső Schön described how he weighed his son 
                    Moshe every week to document his weight loss.<sup><a href=\"#endnote16\" id=\"footnote16\">16</a></sup> Many of the 
                    surviving prisoners weighed just over 30 kilograms (about 66 lbs.) when they were liberated.<sup><a href=\"#endnote17\" id=\"footnote17\">17</a></sup>

                    Unlike other production facilities, the existing tunnel system at Mittelbau-Dora concentration camp meant that 
                    underground production could begin. The prisoners of the 300er Group, too, were deployed in the underground 
                    production facilities. However, production was unable to meet the expectations of the Nazi leadership for a 
                    “miracle weapon” that would influence the course of the war in favor of the Germans, and the planned monthly 
                    production figures were never achieved. Moreover, almost a third of the rockets produced, mainly by starving 
                    concentration camp prisoners, could not be used.<sup><a href=\"#endnote18\" id=\"footnote18\">18</a></sup>
                    The resistance of the prisoners played a significant role in this. Survivors of the 300er Group reported that two 
                    young members of the Group had managed to sabotage the rocket production undetected for a long time and to render 
                    the rockets inoperable.<sup><a href=\"#endnote19\" id=\"footnote19\">19</a></sup>

                    As American troops approached the concentration camp in April 1945, the SS drove the surviving prisoners 
                    of the 300er Group out of Mittelbau-Dora along with thousands of other prisoners.<sup><a href=\"#endnote20\" id=\"footnote20\">20</a></sup> 
                    Apart from those prisoners who were already too weak or ill, the prisoners in the Group were deported to the 
                    Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in freight and cattle cars. The prisoners, already weakened, were not cared 
                    for during the transport, which lasted several days, so that the majority of them did not survive the journey. 
                    Survivor Moshe Shen testified that 100 people were accommodated in his railroad car, only 20 of whom survived 
                    the ten-day journey.<sup><a href=\"#endnote21\" id=\"footnote21\">21</a></sup> 
                    According to estimates, up to 8,000 prisoners did not survive the evacuation transports and death marches from 
                    Mittelbau-Dora.<sup><a href=\"#endnote22\" id=\"footnote22\">22</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The supply situation in the completely overcrowded Bergen-Belsen camp was disastrous, so that more inmates from 
                    the 300er Group were probably murdered there due to the conditions of detention. The approximately 15,000 
                    prisoners from Mittelbau-Dora who arrived in Bergen-Belsen in April 1945 were quartered in former Wehrmacht 
                    barracks, the so-called barracks camp.<sup><a href=\"#endnote23\" id=\"footnote23\">23</a></sup> The surviving prisoners 
                    of the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp were liberated there on April 15, 1945 by British troops, who took over 
                    the concentration camp without a fight.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Upon liberation, the Allies found over 53,000 prisoners starving to death and countless others already dead. 
                    Many thousands continued to die after liberation as a result of their imprisonment. By June 1945 alone, 14,000 
                    former prisoners from Bergen-Belsen had lost their lives. The British troops were not prepared for the appalling 
                    conditions they encountered in Bergen-Belsen. Many prisoners perished, not least because their starving stomachs 
                    could not cope with the food generously distributed by the British soldiers at the beginning. Only after a few 
                    days did the necessary light food arrive.<sup><a href=\"#endnote24\" id=\"footnote24\">24</a></sup>
                    Survivor Moshe Shen recalled that he was too weak at the time of liberation to meet the British and accept the food 
                    that was distributed, which probably saved his life.<sup><a href=\"#endnote25\" id=\"footnote25\">25</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is not possible to definitively determine how many among the Group of 300 survived these last months of their 
                    imprisonment in a concentration camp. One can assume that the majority of them died during this time. While the 
                    prisoners in the Group had previously been treated in a privileged manner and had therefore been able to survive 
                    their time in the satellite camps almost in their entirety, the Group’s special status was rescinded upon arrival 
                    in Mittelbau-Dora. The men were thus subjected to the same treatment by the guards, aimed at exterminating the 
                    prisoners, as the other concentration camp prisoners.

                        The Bergen-Belsen concentration camp was initially founded in 1943 as an “exchange camp” to quarter 
                        Jewish hostages. However, it was quickly assigned other functions and a men’s and women’s camp was set up. 
                        From the end of 1944 onward, Bergen-Belsen became the destination of many death marches and evacuation 
                        transports, developing into a death camp due to the appalling conditions. After liberation, a Polish 
                        and a Jewish displaced persons camp were set up in Bergen-Belsen.<sup><a href=\"#endnote26\" id=\"footnote26\">26</a></sup>

                    The use of concentration camp prisoners in the armaments industry and the negotiations between the SS and 
                    commercial enterprises such as Volkswagen are well documented.<sup><a href=\"#endnote27\" id=\"footnote27\">27</a></sup>
                    However, few documents relating to the bureaucratic processes of the 300er Group have been preserved. Knowledge 
                    about these groups comes mainly from the survivors’ reports, which were created primarily in the course of a 
                    research project on the history of the Volkswagen Corporation and through video interviews conducted by the USC

                    Information about the administrative structure and responsibilities for the satellite camp at the Volkswagen

                    The data they contain illustrates the difficulties in dealing with documents from the concentration camp 
                    administration. For example, the occupations provided by the prisoners are listed. However, these were given 
                    with regard to the selection in Auschwitz and often do not correspond to the persons’ actual occupations. 
                    The profession of journalist Dezső Schön, for example, is given as “fitter.” Dates of birth were also sometimes 
                    deliberately given incorrectly in order to avoid being murdered by the SS. Moshe Shen, Dezső Schön’s son, 
                    claimed to be 20 years old, although he was actually only 14, in order to be classified as fit for work. The 
                    lists were also usually kept by other prisoners who were deployed in the administration. These prisoners 
                    frequently did not speak Hungarian and they were also subjected to inhumane conditions of detention, so the 
                    documents they kept were often incorrect. A comparison of the two lists shows that only 62 of the 298 people 
                    were documented with identical names and data. In particular, merely a fraction of the Hungarian first names 
                    were recorded in the same spelling.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Only because the Group was isolated and deported together has it been possible to assign the different data 
                    to the same persons. In the case of other prisoners, who were usually distributed to satellite camps via main 
                    camps, for example Neuengamme, it is often much more difficult to assign different data due to the gaps in 
                    the records. In addition to documents that were destroyed, administrative records were often no longer kept, 
                    especially in the final months of the war. One can therefore assume that the names of the prisoners from 
                    Mittelbau-Dora who arrived in Bergen-Belsen in April were no longer recorded. The same applies to those who 
                    perished during transportation, for example. Many victims thus remain nameless. We owe our knowledge of the 
                    prisoners’ routes, work assignments, and conditions of detention above all to the reports and testimonies of 
                    the survivors.

                    Some 13.5 million people were conscripted into forced labor in the German Reich during the Second World War. 
                    Maintaining the war economy was only possible thanks to the conscripted workers, prisoners of war, and 
                    concentration camp inmates. They were used in all economic sectors and became part of everyday life in 
                    National Socialist Germany as the war progressed.<sup><a href=\"#endnote1\" id=\"footnote1\">1</a></sup>
                    Among other things, concentration camp prisoners were used in the armaments industry, which the National 
                    Socialists began to relocate underground in 1943 in the face of Allied air superiority. The production of 
                    modern interceptors and rockets in bomb-proof tunnels was intended to avert the increasingly clear signs of 
                    defeat in the war. The majority of the gigantomaniac projects were never completed and most of the production 
                    facilities were never put into operation. The living and working conditions for the concentration camp prisoners 
                    were especially harsh and claimed thousands of lives. The death of Jewish prisoners in particular was calculated 
                    as part of “extermination through work.” The prisoners’ individual chances of survival depended not least on 
                    their assigned work detail. Prisoners who had the necessary professional qualifications or had been trained for 
                    their work detachments over a longer period of time were considered less replaceable.<sup><a href=\"#endnote2\" id=\"footnote2\">2</a></sup>

                    An underground production facility for 10,000 workers was also to be set up in a former ore mine in Thil, France, 
                    by a Volkswagen subsidiary. To this end, VW engineer Arthur Schmiele traveled to the Auschwitz-Birkenau 
                    concentration and extermination camp in June 1944 to select workers from among the Jewish prisoners previously 
                    deported from Hungary. Schmiele put together a group of 500 and a group of 300 men, whom he selected after 
                    checking their professional qualifications as skilled metal workers and a short aptitude test. Accordingly, 
                    both groups contained many metalworkers and some engineers, as well as people from other professions who pretended 
                    to have the appropriate qualifications. Despite their short time in Auschwitz-Birkenau, they had probably realized 
                    that being assigned to a work detachment outside Auschwitz offered a better chance of 
                    survival.<sup><a href=\"#endnote3\" id=\"footnote3\">3</a></sup>

                    The prisoners mainly came from areas in the northeast of what is present-day Romania. In 1940, Romania had 
                    been forced by Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy to cede these areas to Hungary. After the German occupation of 
                    Hungary in March 1944, the German occupiers and Hungarian authorities quickly set up ghettos for the Jewish 
                    population, including on May 3 in what was then Nagyvárad and in Kolozsvár, now Oradea and Cluj Napoca – places 
                    from which many of the deportees in this group came. The Jewish population of the two ghettos was deported to the 
                    Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration and extermination camp at the end of May and beginning of June 1944. There, the 
                    families were separated by gender and all the elderly, sick, or children as well as the mothers and pregnant 
                    women among the deportees were murdered in the gas chambers. Only those prisoners classified as fit for work 
                    survived the selection.<sup><a href=\"#endnote4\" id=\"footnote4\">4</a></sup> As survivors later reported, the 
                    group selected from these transports was very diverse; some had spoken Hungarian in their parents’ homes, 
                    others Romanian, German, Serbian, Yiddish, or a combination of these languages. Some among the group were very 
                    religious, for others religion played no role, some even had Christian families, but all of them were persecuted 
                    as Jews by the National Socialists. Some were already over 50 and others under 20 years of age, with the youngest 
                    only 14 years old. Several fathers managed to be assigned to the group together with their sons, and other prisoners 
                    were already acquainted through their common region of origin or related to each other.<sup><a href=\"#endnote5\" id=\"footnote5\">5</a></sup>

                        The Jewish men and women deported from Hungary belonged to various communities and religious movements within Judaism. 
                        Not all of them necessarily defined themselves as Jewish. Neither their religion nor their cultural affiliation to 
                        Judaism or self-identification was decisive for their persecution by the National Socialists. At the heart of the 
                        National Socialist worldview was a racist antisemitism that defined Jews according to their descent. Christians and 
                        atheists were also persecuted as Jews by the National Socialists, regardless of their self-definition or cultural 
                        affiliation, if they met their criteria of descent. Not all of the persons referred to here as Jews identified themselves 
                        as Jewish, but they were all persecuted as Jewish.

                    While the Group of 500 was deported directly to Thil, the Group of 300 was first deported in cattle cars to 
                    the VW factory in Fallersleben, where they were trained in the assembly of the Fieseler 103 (V1) rocket. 
                    The prisoners had to work twelve-hour shifts every day, with one day off every two weeks. At this time, they 
                    saw no daylight as they were quartered directly in the VW factory in former pithead baths within the same 
                    building where production took place.

                    workers, the 300 men were to form the core workforce of the new underground production facility and the 
                    knowledge they acquired about the manufacture of the rockets was to be kept secret.<sup><a href=\"#endnote6\" id=\"footnote6\">6</a></sup>

        <h3 class=\"mt-4\">Forced labor at VW</h3>
        <div class=\"row\">
            <div class=\"col-lg-8\">
                <p>
                    In 1938 / 1939, Volkswagen GmbH, which had been founded a year earlier, set up its plant near Fallersleben 
                    in what is today Wolfsburg. After the start of the war, cars were not produced there for the German civilian 
                    population as originally planned, but instead armaments orders were taken on. The Volkswagen Group also made 
                    use of the various forms of National Socialist forced labor. By the end of 1944, forced laborers made up two 
                    thirds of the workforce; in total, some 200,000 persons were compelled to perform forced labor at Volkswagen, 
                    many of whom did not survive the working conditions. In addition to civilian forced laborers, Soviet prisoners 
                    of war and Italian military internees, this also included a total of about 5,000 concentration camp inmates. 
                    After the history of the VW Group under National Socialism had become the subject of extensive public discussion 
                    and academic research in the 1980s and 1990s, the VW plant today accommodates a memorial to forced labor on 
                    the site.<sup><a href=\"#endnote7\" id=\"footnote7\">7</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Compared to other concentration camp prisoners, the 300er Group at the VW plant was relatively well looked after. 
                    Even though they did not receive new clothes, they were protected from the weather by their accommodation. 
                    Although set too low for the work required of them, food rations were more extensive than in other camps. 
                    The symptoms of malnutrition typical of many concentration camps, which often led to the death of the prisoners in 
                    the long term, did not initially occur in the 300er Group.<sup><a href=\"#endnote8\" id=\"footnote8\">8</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Due to the prisoners’ training and intended function, the SS and VW initially had an interest in their survival, 
                    but this only extended to the duration of the war and the associated necessity of underground V1 production. 
                    After the war, survivors testified in interviews or memoirs that after their experiences in Auschwitz-Birkenau 
                    and the subsequent concentration camps, in retrospect their time at the Volkswagen factory seemed bearable by 
                    comparison.<sup><a href=\"#endnote9\" id=\"footnote9\">9</a></sup>

                        Reich alone, over 13.5 million people had to perform forced labor during the Second World War. 
                        Forced labor was used in all branches of industry, but also in agriculture and in private households. 
                        Forced laborers were a visible part of everyday life in National Socialist Germany, especially in the 
                        final years of the war.

                <p>
                    At the end of June 1944, the Group’s production facility was destroyed in an Allied bombing raid. Surviving 
                    the attack in a bunker, after a few days the Group was deported from the completely destroyed factory to another 
                    production facility in occupied France. On their way to the camp, which was located in occupied Lorraine, 
                    the Group learned of the Allied landing in Normandy. According to survivor David Hollander, the confirmation 
                    of this news was “the happiest moment” during his imprisonment in a concentration 
                    camp.<sup><a href=\"#endnote10\" id=\"footnote10\">10</a></sup> In Thil, they also met up again with the 
                    Group of 500 men who had been selected together with them in Auschwitz-Birkenau. Here, too, the 300 men were 
                    isolated. Survivors reported that they had to set up their own barracks camp, including a crematorium, which 
                    was separated from the other prisoners by a fence.<sup><a href=\"#endnote11\" id=\"footnote11\">11</a></sup>
                    During the selections, the men had often been separated from friends and relatives, some of whom they now saw 
                    again through the fence. However, any contact was strictly prosecuted. Survivor Eliesar Farkas, among others, 
                    reported that a prisoner in the other group had recognized his brother and sought a conversation with him at 
                    the fence, whereupon he was shot.<sup><a href=\"#endnote12\" id=\"footnote12\">12</a></sup> Survivor Alex Rosenbaum, 
                    on the other hand, managed to secretly exchange a few words with his father in the other camp.<sup><a href=\"#endnote13\" id=\"footnote13\">13</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                    As the production facility in Thil had not yet been completed, the Group was mainly used for clearing and 
                    construction work, despite their extensive training. The Group was also regularly sent to a nearby French village. 
                    Despite being guarded, prisoners there managed to make contact with the French civilian population and the French 
                    resistance movement, the Résistance. Survivors such as Pal Arie testified that one prisoner was even able to 
                    escape with the help of the French Résistance and was taken through the front lines to the US Army, where he was 
                    able to report on the V1 production.<sup><a href=\"#endnote14\" id=\"footnote14\">14</a></sup>
                    The US Army was able to liberate Paris at the end of August. Long before production could begin in Thil, the 
                    satellite camp was evacuated at the beginning of September 1944 as the Allies approached.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Group was then initially transferred to the Rebstock satellite camp of Buchenwald concentration camp. 
                    Here, too, an underground production facility was to be built, but it never went into production. The Group 
                    had previously been increased to 300 again to replace the murdered prisoner and the escaped prisoner. The Group 
                    was deported again at the end of September, this time to the Mittelbau-Dora concentration camp. Due to air raids, 
                    the transport was on the move for several days and probably also stopped at civilian railroad stations for some time.

                    The Mittelbau-Dora concentration camp was originally set up in August 1943 as a satellite camp of Buchenwald 
                    concentration camp as part of the relocation of the armaments industry underground. In October 1944, it was 
                    declared an independent concentration camp. A list compiled after the war assumes that 13,796 prisoners were 
                    already imprisoned in the Mittelbau-Dora main camp by the beginning of November 1944. In total, at least 
                    60,000 prisoners were detained in Mittelbau-Dora – the main camp and satellite camps – during its existence, 
                    with at least 20,000 murdered as a result of the working conditions and the violence inflicted by the guards. 
                    Today a memorial is located at the site of the former concentration camp.<sup><a href=\"#endnote15\" id=\"footnote15\">15</a></sup>

                    Many prisoners from the 300er Group did not survive their time in Mittelbau-Dora. Unlike before, the Group was 
                    no longer isolated there, but above all they were no longer better cared for. Survivors reported on the 
                    unstoppable loss of weight, which meant a race against time in view of the soon hoped-for liberation. In an 
                    account of his time in prison published after the war, survivor Dezső Schön described how he weighed his son 
                    Moshe every week to document his weight loss.<sup><a href=\"#endnote16\" id=\"footnote16\">16</a></sup> Many of the 
                    surviving prisoners weighed just over 30 kilograms (about 66 lbs.) when they were liberated.<sup><a href=\"#endnote17\" id=\"footnote17\">17</a></sup>

                    Unlike other production facilities, the existing tunnel system at Mittelbau-Dora concentration camp meant that 
                    underground production could begin. The prisoners of the 300er Group, too, were deployed in the underground 
                    production facilities. However, production was unable to meet the expectations of the Nazi leadership for a 
                    “miracle weapon” that would influence the course of the war in favor of the Germans, and the planned monthly 
                    production figures were never achieved. Moreover, almost a third of the rockets produced, mainly by starving 
                    concentration camp prisoners, could not be used.<sup><a href=\"#endnote18\" id=\"footnote18\">18</a></sup>
                    The resistance of the prisoners played a significant role in this. Survivors of the 300er Group reported that two 
                    young members of the Group had managed to sabotage the rocket production undetected for a long time and to render 
                    the rockets inoperable.<sup><a href=\"#endnote19\" id=\"footnote19\">19</a></sup>

                <p>
                    As American troops approached the concentration camp in April 1945, the SS drove the surviving prisoners 
                    of the 300er Group out of Mittelbau-Dora along with thousands of other prisoners.<sup><a href=\"#endnote20\" id=\"footnote20\">20</a></sup> 
                    Apart from those prisoners who were already too weak or ill, the prisoners in the Group were deported to the 
                    Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in freight and cattle cars. The prisoners, already weakened, were not cared 
                    for during the transport, which lasted several days, so that the majority of them did not survive the journey. 
                    Survivor Moshe Shen testified that 100 people were accommodated in his railroad car, only 20 of whom survived 
                    the ten-day journey.<sup><a href=\"#endnote21\" id=\"footnote21\">21</a></sup> 
                    According to estimates, up to 8,000 prisoners did not survive the evacuation transports and death marches from 
                    Mittelbau-Dora.<sup><a href=\"#endnote22\" id=\"footnote22\">22</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The supply situation in the completely overcrowded Bergen-Belsen camp was disastrous, so that more inmates from 
                    the 300er Group were probably murdered there due to the conditions of detention. The approximately 15,000 
                    prisoners from Mittelbau-Dora who arrived in Bergen-Belsen in April 1945 were quartered in former Wehrmacht 
                    barracks, the so-called barracks camp.<sup><a href=\"#endnote23\" id=\"footnote23\">23</a></sup> The surviving prisoners 
                    of the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp were liberated there on April 15, 1945 by British troops, who took over 
                    the concentration camp without a fight.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Upon liberation, the Allies found over 53,000 prisoners starving to death and countless others already dead. 
                    Many thousands continued to die after liberation as a result of their imprisonment. By June 1945 alone, 14,000 
                    former prisoners from Bergen-Belsen had lost their lives. The British troops were not prepared for the appalling 
                    conditions they encountered in Bergen-Belsen. Many prisoners perished, not least because their starving stomachs 
                    could not cope with the food generously distributed by the British soldiers at the beginning. Only after a few 
                    days did the necessary light food arrive.<sup><a href=\"#endnote24\" id=\"footnote24\">24</a></sup>
                    Survivor Moshe Shen recalled that he was too weak at the time of liberation to meet the British and accept the food 
                    that was distributed, which probably saved his life.<sup><a href=\"#endnote25\" id=\"footnote25\">25</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is not possible to definitively determine how many among the Group of 300 survived these last months of their 
                    imprisonment in a concentration camp. One can assume that the majority of them died during this time. While the 
                    prisoners in the Group had previously been treated in a privileged manner and had therefore been able to survive 
                    their time in the satellite camps almost in their entirety, the Group’s special status was rescinded upon arrival 
                    in Mittelbau-Dora. The men were thus subjected to the same treatment by the guards, aimed at exterminating the 
                    prisoners, as the other concentration camp prisoners.

                        The Bergen-Belsen concentration camp was initially founded in 1943 as an “exchange camp” to quarter 
                        Jewish hostages. However, it was quickly assigned other functions and a men’s and women’s camp was set up. 
                        From the end of 1944 onward, Bergen-Belsen became the destination of many death marches and evacuation 
                        transports, developing into a death camp due to the appalling conditions. After liberation, a Polish 
                        and a Jewish displaced persons camp were set up in Bergen-Belsen.<sup><a href=\"#endnote26\" id=\"footnote26\">26</a></sup>

                    The use of concentration camp prisoners in the armaments industry and the negotiations between the SS and 
                    commercial enterprises such as Volkswagen are well documented.<sup><a href=\"#endnote27\" id=\"footnote27\">27</a></sup>
                    However, few documents relating to the bureaucratic processes of the 300er Group have been preserved. Knowledge 
                    about these groups comes mainly from the survivors’ reports, which were created primarily in the course of a 
                    research project on the history of the Volkswagen Corporation and through video interviews conducted by the USC 
                    Shoah Foundation from the 1980s onward.<sup><a href=\"#endnote28\" id=\"footnote28\">28</a></sup>
                    Information about the administrative structure and responsibilities for the satellite camp at the Volkswagen 
                    plant is therefore very limited. The only source that has survived is a copy of a prisoner list that the surviving 
                    prisoner Dezső Schön had secretly prepared and carried with him. In addition, an admissions list of the Rebstock 
                    satellite camp, also containing the prisoner data, has been preserved.<sup><a href=\"#endnote29\" id=\"footnote29\">29</a></sup>

                    The data they contain illustrates the difficulties in dealing with documents from the concentration camp 
                    administration. For example, the occupations provided by the prisoners are listed. However, these were given 
                    with regard to the selection in Auschwitz and often do not correspond to the persons’ actual occupations. 
                    The profession of journalist Dezső Schön, for example, is given as “fitter.” Dates of birth were also sometimes 
                    deliberately given incorrectly in order to avoid being murdered by the SS. Moshe Shen, Dezső Schön’s son, 
                    claimed to be 20 years old, although he was actually only 14, in order to be classified as fit for work. The 
                    lists were also usually kept by other prisoners who were deployed in the administration. These prisoners 
                    frequently did not speak Hungarian and they were also subjected to inhumane conditions of detention, so the 
                    documents they kept were often incorrect. A comparison of the two lists shows that only 62 of the 298 people 
                    were documented with identical names and data. In particular, merely a fraction of the Hungarian first names 
                    were recorded in the same spelling.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Only because the Group was isolated and deported together has it been possible to assign the different data 
                    to the same persons. In the case of other prisoners, who were usually distributed to satellite camps via main 
                    camps, for example Neuengamme, it is often much more difficult to assign different data due to the gaps in 
                    the records. In addition to documents that were destroyed, administrative records were often no longer kept, 
                    especially in the final months of the war. One can therefore assume that the names of the prisoners from 
                    Mittelbau-Dora who arrived in Bergen-Belsen in April were no longer recorded. The same applies to those who 
                    perished during transportation, for example. Many victims thus remain nameless. We owe our knowledge of the 
                    prisoners’ routes, work assignments, and conditions of detention above all to the reports and testimonies of 
                    the survivors.
